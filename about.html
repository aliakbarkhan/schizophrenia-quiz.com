        <p><span style="font-size: 16">Community-based and recovery-focused supports. Our support always starts with co-creating a unique support plan that captures each person's individual requirements, current situation and desired personal outcomes.  But peoples’ outcomes change and support needs are not constant, so we react, adapt and adjust as people’s lives change.<br>Whilst each person’s support is unique, there are common themes around which people seek support to improve their health, wellbeing and participation in life, including:</span>

<ul><li>Maximising independence in the home, including tenancy agreements, finances and personal care</li>
<li>Building and maintaining relationships with family, friends and other networks</li>
<li>Managing medication and treatment programmes</li>
<li>Shopping and cooking healthy meals on a budget</li>
<li>Enjoying education, employment or volunteering</li>
<li>Attending social activities, connecting with local resources and trying new things</ul></p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 16">Identifying goals with each person and adopting a “do with” method, rather than “do for”.  We are tenacious and do not give up on people. <br><br>

Our specially trained practitioners develop strong support relationships, break down barriers and positively persist with people to ensure they are informed, engaged and active citizens in their home and community.</span>
